Restaurant Management System
This repository contains a Python-based Restaurant Management System designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and recursive functions. The software aims to streamline restaurant operations, including managing orders, inventory, and customer interactions. It provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate smooth day-to-day management.

Key Features:
Object-Oriented Design (OOP): The system is structured around key entities such as Order, Menu, Customer, and Staff, utilizing classes and objects to ensure modularity and code reusability.
Recursive Functions: Certain functionalities within the system, such as calculating the total cost of an order or navigating through menu categories, are implemented using recursive algorithms for better performance and clarity.
Interactive UI: The application features an intuitive interface for easy interaction with users, including real-time updates of orders and menu items.
Upcoming Features:
Feedback Button: A new feedback functionality will be added to allow customers to submit reviews or suggestions, enhancing user experience and providing valuable insights for restaurant management.
Contact Button: A contact button will be integrated into the UI, enabling customers to reach out for inquiries, support, or other requests directly through the application.
Technologies Used:
Python
Tkinter (for the UI)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Recursive Functions
This system serves as a foundational tool for managing restaurant operations and will be continuously improved with additional features and optimizations.
